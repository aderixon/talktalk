Talktalk problem report
=======================

**Background**: Existing Essentials contract with simple broadband expired
on 10th Dec 2015. Renewed to Fibre Broadband (medium), with go-live date
of 30th Dec.

* 30th Dec: phone line goes dead at midday, does not return.

* 31st Dec: reported issue under call ref. **INC000012924959**.

* 2nd Jan: Openreach engineer attended, restored phone. Router initiated
  VDSL connection but no Internet service present (red light). Reported
issue again: told connection hasn't been activated.

* 3rd Jan: chased again, told waiting for more work by Openreach. No ETA.

* 5th Jan: told to expect update from case manager tomorrow.

* 6th Jan: Case manager called home line while I was at work and was
forcibly referred to my mobile number by partner (after suggesting that
we call back). Said installation was delayed as Openreach hadn't been
able to complete it. Expected Openreach work to complete on 14th Jan but
would call with update on 11th. Repeatedly said, "do not be worried" when
told this delay was unacceptable and pressed for a firm delivery date.

* 8th Jan: Internet service resumed at 4pm without notice but router
  showing ADSL\_g.dmt connection only with 8Mbps line speed (~3Mbps actual).
Connection became unusably slow from around 9pm; this pattern has
continued since.

* 13th Jan: Chased with Talktalk. Advised that case was closed as testing
  showed that the line was up and router was connected. Line speed showing
as 28-30Mbps. Was asked to try swapping microfilter and using master
socket (wasn't at home to test).

* 16th Jan: tested as advised, no difference. Line now reaches maximum of
  6Mbps but varies widely and often interrupted, becoming unusably slow in
evenings. Rang Talktalk and followed automated prompts but informed that
their systems were down for maintenance and they were unable to log calls.
By 8pm, line speed drops to < 1Mbps typical, as usual.

* 18th Jan: rang TT customer service again. Informed that fibre broadband still
showing as not activated (note that this directly contradicts what I was told
during call on 13th). Passed to Billing team who escalated the issue; told that
an email would be sent in the next 24-48 hours with an activation date.
Updated mobile number on contact details for future reference.

* 19th Jan: @talktalkcare told me that my order was still showing as delayed
because Openreach were unable to complete the installation. TT Case Manager
will contact me on 21st with an update. (Note that this is almost word for
word a repeat of information last given on 6th.)

## Costs so far

* £130 xmas break on call allowance, unable to claim as unable to work
  online.

* £14.50 4G data boost on Giffgaff and 3 mobiles to cover for lack of
  broadband.

## Analysis

This screenshot of the HG633 DSL connection status indicates the
underlying issue: the line is running as ADSL instead of VDSL.

## What Talktalk can do to fix this

* **Escalate** the fault and get the fibre line up asap; get a grip on
this.

* Offer appropriate compensation promptly, unasked, for the total and
partial loss of service, for failing to meet the original go-live date
and for repeated failures to resolve the problem.

* Have someone in the UK **call me** to discuss this situation,
explain why it occurred and what steps are being put in place to
ensure it does not happen again.

* Review my service again in 30 days time to ensure that it is still
satisfactory.

## Other options

Since Talktalk have failed to provide the promised service
to the specified standard from day one, they would appear to be
in breach of contract.
