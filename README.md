Talktalk problem report
=======================

**Background**: Existing Essentials contract with simple broadband expired
on 10th Dec 2015. Renewed to Fibre Broadband (medium), with go-live date
of 30th Dec.

* 30th Dec: phone line goes dead at midday, does not return.

* 31st Dec: reported issue under call ref. **INC000012924959**.

* 2nd Jan: Openreach engineer attended, restored phone. Router initiated
  VDSL connection but no Internet service present (red light). Reported
issue again: told connection hasn't been activated.

* 3rd Jan: chased again, told waiting for more work by Openreach. No ETA.

* 5th Jan: told to expect update from case manager tomorrow.

* 6th Jan: Case manager called home line while I was at work and was
  forcibly referred to my mobile number by partner (after suggesting that
we call back). Expected Openreach work to complete on 14th Jan but would
call with update on 11th. Repeatedly said, "do not be worried" when told
this delay was unacceptable.

* 8th Jan: Internet service resumed at 4pm without notice but router
  showing ADSL\_g.dmt connection only with 8Mbps line speed (~3Mbps actual).
Connection became unusably slow from around 9pm; this pattern has
continued since.

* 13th Jan: Chased with Talktalk. Advised that case was closed as testing
  showed that the line was up and router was connected. Line speed showing
as 28-30Mbps. Was asked to try swapping microfilter and using master
socket (wasn't at home to test).

* 16th Jan: tested as advised, no difference. Line now reaches maximum of
  6Mbps but varies widely and often interrupted, becoming unusably slow in
evenings. Rang Talktalk and followed automated prompts but informed that
their systems were down for maintenance and they were unable to log calls.
By 8pm, line speed drops to < 1Mbps typical, as usual.

## Costs so far:

* £130 xmas break on call allowance, unable to claim as unable to work
  online.

* £14.50 4G data boost on Giffgaff and 3 mobiles to cover for lack of
  broadband.
